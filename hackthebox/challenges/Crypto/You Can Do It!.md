### Message
We have this text:

```
YHAOANUTDSYOEOIEUTTC!
```

---
### Caesar box
This text uses a Caesar box to hide the text. We can see the word `You` if we ignore the characters in between. This gave us the idea of a box of three columns, so we write it:

| Y | H | A |
|---|---|---|
| O | A | N |
| U | T | D |
| S | Y | O |
| E | O | I |
| E | U | T |
| T | C | ! |

And reading column by column, we obtain this text:

> YOUSEETHATYOUCANDOIT!
---
### Flag
The flag is:

> HTB{YOUSEETHATYOUCANDOIT!}
